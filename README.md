Deep Fake Detection

Nowadays, people all enjoy sharing their lives via video platforms like TikTok
and Kuaishou. However, due to the development of deep fake technologies,
many online videos are actually synthesised intentionally. In this problem, you
need to design and implement a fake video detection algorithm by yourself.

Data description
1. You can download the whole dataset from https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101/UCF101.rar.
2. Each sub-folder denotes one category of videos. For example, for videos in
./ApplyEyeMakeup folder, their labels are all ’ApplyEyeMakeup’. These videos are all real instead of synthesised.
